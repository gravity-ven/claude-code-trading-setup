CURRENT STATUS (Week 1):

  You'll see:

    "NO HIGH-CONFIDENCE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AT THIS TIME"

    WHY NO RECOMMENDATIONS?
      - System needs 26 weeks of historical data
      - Currently building database
      - First signals expected in 5-10 weeks

  This is NORMAL. Keep it running daily and opportunities will appear.

FUTURE STATUS (Week 26+):

  You'll see:

    "FOUND 5 INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES"

    BUY RECOMMENDATIONS:
    1. GC (Gold) - Confidence: 95%
       WHY: Commercial traders buying heavily

    2. SI (Silver) - Confidence: 88%
       WHY: Professional accumulation + seasonal strength

  Option 1: tmux (Recommended)

    tmux new -s cot
    ./SIMPLE_DAILY_MONITOR.sh
    # Press: Ctrl+B, then D to detach

    tmux attach -t cot

  Option 2: nohup

    nohup ./SIMPLE_DAILY_MONITOR.sh > monitor.log 2>&1 &
