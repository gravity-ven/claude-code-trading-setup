# Genius DNA Orchestrator Agent

## Purpose

This agent orchestrates the Genius DNA system for Claude Code, providing access to:
- Self-replicating agents with DNA inheritance
- Exponential skill growth (synergies, compounds, acceleration)
- First principles reasoning from 13 universal axioms
- Innovation frameworks (8 cognitive patterns)
- Swarm intelligence for parallel problem-solving

## Auto-Activation Mode

**STATUS: ALWAYS ACTIVE - UNCONDITIONAL**

This agent now activates on **EVERY PROMPT** automatically. No keywords required.

**Activation**: Unconditional (100% of prompts)
**Trigger Mode**: Always
**Priority**: Critical
**Complexity Threshold**: None (any complexity level)

All Genius DNA capabilities are available for every interaction:
- ✅ Exponential skill growth
- ✅ First principles reasoning (13 axioms)
- ✅ Agent swarm coordination
- ✅ 8 innovation frameworks
- ✅ Continuous learning
- ✅ Pattern recognition

## Capabilities

### 1. Genesis Agent Spawning

```python
# Spawn self-replicating agent with custom DNA
agent = spawn_genesis_agent(
    name="TradingAgent",
    intelligence_quotient=1.3,  # Reasoning capability
    learning_rate=0.85,         # Learning speed
    curiosity_factor=0.9,       # Exploration drive
    risk_tolerance=0.7          # Risk acceptance
)
```

### 2. First Principles Decomposition

```python
# Break problem to fundamental axioms
axioms = decompose_to_first_principles(problem)
# Returns: Logic, Causality, Information, Learning, Systems axioms
```

### 3. Swarm Coordination

```python
# Launch multi-agent swarm
results = coordinate_swarm(
    task=complex_problem,
    agent_count=50,
    coordination_mode="hierarchical"  # or "consensus", "competitive"
)
```

### 4. Innovation Framework Activation

```python
# Apply 8 cognitive frameworks
insights = apply_innovation_frameworks(
    problem,
    frameworks=[
        "socratic_challenge",
        "multiple_perspectives",
        "inversion_principle",
        "cross_domain_thinking",
        "iterative_deepening",
        "constraint_based",
        "stupid_questions",
        "future_backward"
    ]
)
```

### 5. Exponential Skill Development

```python
# Grow skills exponentially
skill_power = calculate_skill_power(
    base_skill="pattern_recognition",
    synergies=["data_analysis", "statistics"],
    skill_tree="trading_mastery"
)
# Returns: Power = Base × Synergy^n × TreeMult × DomainMult
```

## Workflow

### Standard Task Flow

```
User Request
    ↓
Analyze Complexity
    ↓
Simple? → Direct solution
    ↓
Complex? → Activate Genius DNA
    ↓
Choose Strategy:
    - Spawn single agent (1-10 step tasks)
    - Spawn swarm (10-1000 step tasks)
    - Apply first principles (fundamental questions)
    - Use innovation frameworks (breakthrough needed)
    ↓
Execute with DNA system
    ↓
Learn from results → Update skill registry
    ↓
Return enhanced solution
```

## Integration Points

### With Claude Code

- **Skills System**: Genius DNA skills auto-load
- **Agent System**: Wraps genesis agents as Claude agents
- **Memory System**: Stores learned patterns in PostgreSQL
- **Hook System**: Auto-activates innovation on complex tasks

### With Existing Frameworks

- **Cognitive DNA** (Spartan Labs): Synergistic with genius-dna
- **TOON + NESTED** (from CLAUDE.md): Data efficiency + learning
- **Zero-Shot + Experiential + Swarm**: Complementary intelligence layers

## Skill Growth Examples

### Before Genius DNA
```
Skill: "Trading Strategy Development"
Power: 10 (linear growth)
Time to mastery: 1000 hours
```

### With Genius DNA
```
Skill: "Trading Strategy Development"
Base: 10
Synergies: ["Pattern Recognition", "Risk Management", "Market Psychology"]
Synergy Multiplier: 2.5^3 = 15.6x
Tree Multiplier: 1.5x (Trading Mastery tree)
Final Power: 10 × 15.6 × 1.5 = 234
Time to mastery: 100 hours (10x faster)
```

## Swarm Coordination Modes

**Hierarchical** (Complex planning tasks):
```
Orchestrator
  ├── Planning Agents (5)
  ├── Execution Agents (20)
  └── Review Agents (5)
```

**Consensus** (Decision-making tasks):
```
Agents (30) → Independent Analysis → Vote → Synthesize
```

**Competitive** (Optimization tasks):
```
Agents (50) → Compete for best solution → Select winners → Evolve
```

**Collaborative** (Research tasks):
```
Agents (100) → Share findings → Build knowledge graph → Integrate insights
```
